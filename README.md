# Tetris Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tetris game using Pygame. The game features traditional Tetris mechanics, including block movement, rotation, line clearing, and scoring.

## Overview

The Tetris game is implemented with Python and Pygame. The main class `Tetris` handles game initialization, logic, rendering, and user input. The game board and blocks are dynamically managed, with blocks falling from the top of the screen and players aiming to clear lines by forming complete rows.

## Features

- Block movement: Move blocks left, right, and down.
- Rotation: Rotate blocks to fit them into the board.
- Line clearing: Clear completed lines and score points.
- Game over: End the game when blocks stack up to the top.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
